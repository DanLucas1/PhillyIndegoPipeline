# Data Engineering: Philadelphia Indego Pipeline & Dashboard

## Introduction
This project is an example Data Engineering pipeline to consume and visualize bikeshare data from Philadelphia's Indego bike service. 

Created using guidelines for the capstone project of the DataTalksClub [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp). The project has not submitted or graded because I took the course self-paced outside of the usual yearly schedule. Source data is from Indego's [public ride data](https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/).
