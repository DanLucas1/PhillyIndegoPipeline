# Data Engineering: Philadelphia Indego Pipeline & Dashboard

## Introduction
This project is an example Data Engineering pipeline to consume and visualize bikeshare data from Philadelphia's Indego bike service. Historical ride data will come from Indego's [public ride data](https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/). And streaming station updates will be sourced from https://bts-status.bicycletransit.workers.dev/phl.

The project is informed by the guidelines for the capstone project of the DataTalksClub [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) but may deviate from those guidelines because my schedule for the course did not align with the 2024 live cohort and the project therefore isn't being graded.

### Current Project Status: building cloud infrastructure in Google Cloud Platform:
- Cloud storage buckets for data file storage
- Cloud Run containers for orchestration with [Mage](https://www.mage.ai/)
- Dataproc Clusters for Spark batch processing
- BigQuery for Data Warehousing

Further documentation and updates TK.
